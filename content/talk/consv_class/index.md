For the past two years, I have had the pleasure of assisting in the <a href="http://www.simiens.com/index.php/videos/details/conservation-classes-at-simien-lodge" target="_blank">Conservation Classes</a> run annually by the Simien Lodge, where children from local communities come to learn about nature, science, and conservation. Through a mix of lectures, games, drawing, and face-painting we help the children learn how they can help protect their park.
