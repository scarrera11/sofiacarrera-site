The early-life environment can affect offspring directly and indirectly, through the mother. One pathway through which the mother transfers information about the environment is through hormones, specifically glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids increase in response to energetically challenging stimuli. For example, when an individual receives aggression or does not have enough food. 

The first part of my dissertatin aims to determine what factors are associated with high levels of glucocorticoids in wild gelada females. Using non-invasively collected fecal samples, I have found that females who are low-ranking or who are first-time mothers have higher levels of glucocorticoids during pregnancy.
