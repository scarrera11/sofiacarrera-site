If a mother is facing energetic challenges, she may reduce invest in her offspring. One way to do so is by exhibiting reduced maternal care. 

Through behavioral observations of mothers with infants aged 0-6 months, I will test if mothers with high levels of glucocorticoids show different rates of maternal care behaviors compared with mothers with average or low levels of glucocorticoids. 

I am examining positive behaviors such as nursing and grooming time, as well as negative behaviors such as rejecting and pushing the offspring.
