I am a PhD candidate in biopsychology at the University of Michigan in the Simien Mountain Gelada Research Project group. My  interests span behavioral endocrinology, developmental biology, and life history. I address my research questions with behavioral observations and hormone sample collection. My dissertation focuses on early-life adversity and maternal effects in a wild primate - geladas.
