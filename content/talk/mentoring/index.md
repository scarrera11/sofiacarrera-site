I have greatly enjoyed mentoring undergraduates in our lab at the University of Michigan. Students learn how to work in an endocrinology laboratory, starting with processing and storing samples and then advancing to running enzyme immunoassays independently. Students also learn how to use Photoshop and assist in measuring the size of infant and juvenile geladas. This work, along with the SMGRP's longterm data, is available for the students to conduct their own research projects. 
<br>
Previous students have examined testosterone and glucocorticoid concentrations in male geladas. Currently, a student is examining if glucocorticoid concentrations in female geladas increase when their unit is taken over by a new male.
