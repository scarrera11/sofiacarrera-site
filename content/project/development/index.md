Through developmental plasticity, offspring may alter their developmental trajectories in response to an adverse early-life environment. Potentially, they can receive cues directly from the environment, through their mother's glucocorticoids, or through their mother's care. 

I will test how the environment, maternal glucocorticoids, and/or maternal care impact offspring development by examining four different types of outcomes in offspring: 1) growth rate, 2) motor skill acquisition, 3) immune function, and 4) independence.
