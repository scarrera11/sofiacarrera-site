In 2018, I became a Science Communication fellow through the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History's <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/u-m-community/u-m-faculty/science-communication-fellows.html" target="_blank">Portal to the Public</a> program. In that program I designed an activity for children to collect behavioral data using an ethogram. So far, I have presented this activity at three different events in southeast Michigan.
