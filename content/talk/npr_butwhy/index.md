NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids" target="_blank">But Why</a> podcast is a wonderful resource for teachers and families. The producers contact me to answer a child's question about monkey behavior. My recorded answer is in the episode posted on April 12, 2019. 

I hope to continue serving as a resource for the But Why podcast and other forms of social media and science communication!
