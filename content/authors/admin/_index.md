I am fascinated by individual variations in behavior, health, and fitness, and my research aims to uncover the drivers of these variations. Currently, I focus on how the early-life environment shapes offspring development and health in a wild population of monkeys (geladas) with the Simien Mountains Gelada Research Project (<a href="https://geladaresearch.org/" target="_blank">SMGRP</a>). Through behavioral observations and non-invasive sample collection I examine how offspring adjust their developmental trajectory when faced with early-life adversity. I believe such research in non-human primates is critical for understanding and improving health disparities in human populations. 

I conduct all of my research analyses using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank">R programming language</a>. I believe that open source software is a major step in making science and research more inclusive and accessible. I make sure that my mentoring of undergraduate students includes teaching them the basics of R to jumpstart their development as independent researchers. 

In addition to being a science nerd, I enjoy spending my time outdoors, whether that be by taking a daily walk or by rock climbing. Also, until I have my own dog I will ask to pet yours when I see it out and about.
