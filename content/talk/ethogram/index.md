Through the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, I became a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/u-m-community/u-m-faculty/science-communication-fellows.html" target="_blank">Science Communication Fellow</a> by participating in worshops run through the Portal to the Public program.

In these workshops, I designed an activity for children to learn how to record animal behavioral data. Using scan sampling, the children watch one individual in a short video of gelada monkeys and mark the type of behavior that the individual is involved in at pre-determined intervals. So far, I have presented this activity to school-aged children at three different events throughout southeast Michigan. The kids love finding out that they can do the same thing with their own pets, animals in their backyard, or at the zoo!
